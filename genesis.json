How deeply the water cycle extends into the Earth's mantle is not known. However, evidence is mounting that certain mantle minerals such as ringwoodite, found in a layer called the transition zone (410-660 km depth), may contain a significant -if not the largest- geochemical reservoir of H2O in the planet. The presence of just a few weight percent H2O bound in minerals of the transition zone would constitute more water than is present in the oceans.

In the geological world, a major reservoir of water is tied up in solid rock deep in the Earth where it is chemically bound to the minerals. In these minerals, water is present both as the H2O molecule, and also as its precursor, the hydrogen atom bound to oxygen atoms in the form of hydroxide groups. Although the concentrations are relatively low, usually less than a few hundred parts per million, the volume of this rock is great. A large proportion of this water is incorporated into minerals we normally think of as anhydrous. These nominally anhydrous minerals include feldspars, quartz, olivine, garnets, and pyroxenes. For a couple decades, the Caltech lab has developed the first generation of analytical standards for determining the 'water' content of nominally anhydrous minerals using a variety of analytical tools.

This is one of the few places in the world that has all of the ingredients necessary for a comprehensive study of early rifting. Active and passive seismic data and MT data will reveal the 3D structure of the crust and lithosphere at a variety of length scales, from the architecture of border faults and accommodation zones to the distribution of deformation and magma (if present) in the mantle lithosphere. Surface deformation, seismicity, and rift stratigraphy, as well as geochronology, thermobarometry and geochemistry of volcanic rocks, will yield constraints on the origin of magmatism and the evolution of deformation and magmatism at a range of time scales, including possibly variable contributions from sub-lithospheric versus lithospheric sources. Comparisons of active and cumulative deformation patterns will enable the evaluation of the importance of episodicity, seismicity and magmatism in accommodating extension and how they relate to segmentation. This powerful combination of temporal and spatial constraints will produce unique insights into the initiation of segmentation and magmatism during continental rifting.\",\"milestones\":[{\"goal\":\"Project launch\",\"details\":\"Team gathering, set the primary scientific goal that is to examine the emergence and early evolution of two fundamental features of all divergent plate boundaries: magmatism and segmentation.\",\"eta\":\"2019-04-30T21:00:00.000Z\",\"is_active\":true},{\"goal\":\"Travel to northern Lake Malawi region in the East African Rift System\",\"details\":\"Trip is guided to get the answers for the following questions:\\n1.

This effort represents some of the first observations of seismometer derived noise levels in a freshwater rather than oceanic environment. Our resulting phase-velocity maps present two views of the rift system. At the shortest periods and hence shallowest depths, low velocities are bounded to the North and Central basins as a result of thick sedimentary packages. Low velocities beneath the lake basins extend to 40 s, where sensitivities are within the lower crust and potentially uppermost lithospheric mantle suggesting a localization of extensional processes. At the longest periods, our phase-velocity images reveal a ubiquitous low-velocity region associated with the RVP and the colocated accommodation zone. Our data provide ex-cellent ray coverage such that we can constrain the RVP anomaly and show that similar-magnitude low-velocity regions do not extend north into the Rukwa Rift or south along the Malawi Rift. Estimates of phase-velocity sensitivity place these low velocities within the lithospheric mantle and potentially uppermost asthenosphere, suggesting that mantle processes may control the association sphere, suggesting that mantle processes may control the association of volcanic centres and the localization of magmatism.\",\"eta\":\"2019-10-11T21:00:00.000Z\",\"is_active\":false}],\"video_src\":\"\"}",

The thermodynamic constraint arises from the large vertical gradients in the emission and absorption of longwave radiation by water vapor at upper tropospheric levels which, in turn, arise from the temperature dependence of saturation vapor pressure. As temperature drops with height in the upper troposphere, so do water vapor concentrations in accordance with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, and hence so does the radiative cooling by water vapor. Altitudes at which temperatures are warm enough to support large water vapor concentrations are characterized by robust clear-sky cooling by water vapor and are thus conducive to vigorous diabatic mixing; altitudes above this level support only weak clear-sky cooling and thus relatively modest diabatic mixing.\",\"eta\":\"2020-01-20T21:00:00.000Z\",\"is_active\":false}],\"video_src\":\"\"}",
