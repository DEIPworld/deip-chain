This set of categories is an important consensus statement of the breadth of information types required for ocean planning from a national, multidisciplinary perspective. Although the categories were described in a working document in 2018, they have not yet been fully implemented explicitly in online services or geospatial metadata, in part because authoritative definitions were not created formally. This document describes the purpose of the data categories, provides definitions, and identifies relations among the categories and between the categories and external standards. It is intended to be used by ocean data providers, managers, and users in order to provide a transparent and consistent framework for organizing and describing complex information about marine ecosystems and their connections to humans.

      "title": "Hydration State of the Transition Zone and Lowermost Mantle",
      "abstract": "The global water cycle is connected to the Earth's deep interior through plate tectonics. Hydrous minerals within oceanic crust carry the components of water (H2O) into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries, having influence on melt generation and volcanism as part of a cycle that returns H2O to the surface repeatedly over geologic time. How deeply the water cycle extends into the Earth's mantle is not known. However, evidence is mounting that certain mantle minerals such as ringwoodite, found in a layer called the transition zone (410-660 km depth), may contain a significant -if not the largest- geochemical reservoir of H2O in the planet. The presence of just a few weight percent H2O bound in minerals of the transition zone would constitute more water than is present in the oceans. Determining the scale and distribution of H2O in the mantle has implications for understanding the geochemical water cycle, deep melt generation, and determining the Earth's composition and origin of Earth's water.",

      "abstract": "Water is essential not only to life, but also to geological processes such as volcanic eruption, magma melting and rising, and rock deformation. In the geological world, a major reservoir of water is tied up in solid rock deep in the Earth where it is chemically bound to the minerals. In these minerals, water is present both as the H2O molecule, and also as its precursor, the hydrogen atom bound to oxygen atoms in the form of hydroxide groups. Although the concentrations are relatively low, usually less than a few hundred parts per million, the volume of this rock is great. A large proportion of this water is incorporated into minerals we normally think of as anhydrous. These nominally anhydrous minerals include feldspars, quartz, olivine, garnets, and pyroxenes. For a couple decades, the Caltech lab has developed the first generation of analytical standards for determining the 'water' content of nominally anhydrous minerals using a variety of analytical tools. These standards have seen wide distribution across the United States and abroad. The standards were originally developed for use with infrared spectroscopy, but now, another analytical technique known as secondary ion mass spectrometry offers comparable or better sensitivity on smaller areas.",

In the marine realm, most resilience studies have focused on shallow-water ecosystems but increasing anthropogenic impacts in the deep-sea are making studies of resilience and recovery in the deep-sea time-critical, with deep-sea hard-substrate habitats and large-scale disturbances having received the least attention. Ironically one of the key anthropogenic impacts to the seafloor, fish trawling, provides an experimental design to understand processes of recovery from large-scale disturbance. Seamounts, with a high proportion of hard-substrate habitat, discreet locations for sampling, and extensive disturbance from fish trawling, provide an excellent natural laboratory to study the recovery aspect of resilience. Additionally, the abundance, numerical dominance, high biomass, and diversity of deep-sea corals on seamounts make them ideal model organisms for these studies.",

Active and passive seismic data and MT data will reveal the 3D structure of the crust and lithosphere at a variety of length scales, from the architecture of border faults and accommodation zones to the distribution of deformation and magma (if present) in the mantle lithosphere. Surface deformation, seismicity, and rift stratigraphy, as well as geochronology, thermobarometry and geochemistry of volcanic rocks, will yield constraints on the origin of magmatism and the evolution of deformation and magmatism at a range of time scales, including possibly variable contributions from sub-lithospheric versus lithospheric sources. Comparisons of active and cumulative deformation patterns will enable the evaluation of the importance of episodicity, seismicity and magmatism in accommodating extension and how they relate to segmentation. This powerful combination of temporal and spatial constraints will produce unique insights into the initiation of segmentation and magmatism during continental rifting.",

Their physical functionalities can be coupled by stacking layers of such materials to create heterostructures and can be further boosted by applying strain. The predominant method for heterogeneous integration and application of strain has been through heteroepitaxy, which drastically limits the possible material combinations and the ability to integrate complex oxides with mature semiconductor technologies. Moreover, key physical properties of complex-oxide thin films, such as piezoelectricity and magnetostriction, are severely reduced by the substrate clamping effect. Here we demonstrate a universal mechanical exfoliation method of producing freestanding single-crystalline membranes made from a wide range of complex-oxide materials including perovskite, spinel and garnet crystal structures with varying crystallographic orientations. In addition, we create artificial heterostructures and hybridize their physical properties by directly stacking such freestanding membranes with different crystal structures and orientations, which is not possible using conventional methods.

      "title": "Chemically Modified Carbon Cathodes of High Capacity Li-O2 Batteries",
      "abstract": "Li-O2 batteries are poised to transform the consumer electronic and electric vehicle markets because they possess a theoretical energy density of 3,213 W h/kg, three fold larger than the current state of the art. This dramatic boost in energy density is provided by the carbon-based Li-O2 cathode, at which O2 is reduced to Li2O2 upon cell discharge. However, the insoluble Li2O2 precipitates indiscriminately on the surface of the carbon cathode, inhibiting subsequent reduction of O2, leading to diminished capacity, poor rate capability, and poor round-trip efficiency. These challenges could be overcome if the surfaces of carbon cathodes can be modified to discourage the indiscriminate nucleation and growth of Li2O2 crystallites. We hypothesize that Li2O2 nucleation occurs via Li+ coordination to oxidic surface functionalities including ketones, carboxylic acids, and alcohols, which are known to be prevalent on carbon surfaces. Thus, we will apply well-known oxygen protecting group (PG) chemistries (e.g. silylation, benzylation, alkylation) to carbon electrodes to impede the nucleation of Li2O2 crystallites. By reducing the nucleation site density, fewer, larger Li2O2 crystallites will be favored, leaving the majority of the electrode surface available to sustain rapid O2 reduction, thereby, enabling high energy and power densities.",

      "abstract": "We are developing nano-devices using meta-materials that can non-invasively and remotely monitor and modulate our biological system. The requirements of the system are: 1) they should be as small as possible such that the volume displacement of tissue due to the placement of the device is minimal, and 2) they should be untethered/wireless such that they can be remotely controlled. Such a device will sense the biological environment and send the information to a system outside the body in real time. The device will also have the capability to do internal analysis of the sensed data and depending on the analysis results, take further action such as electrical stimulation or drug delivery. The device will harvest energy from external applied fields for its functioning and also modulate the external fields for communicating sensed data. The possibilities with such bioelectronic devices are endless, and we are exploring, among others, brain activity recording at a large scale with the precision of a single neuron, activity recording in spinal cord and peripheral nervous systems, monitoring tumor microenvironment, observing response to pathology development or external stimulus at a single cell level, along with integrated functionalities such as stimulation and drug delivery.",
